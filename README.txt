Anagram Finder Project:

This Java based Anagram Finder is used to scan any dictionary or text file
and find the words in the file with the most Anagrams. The Anagram Finder will output these
words, along with all of there anagrams that were found in the text file. 

Configurable Data Structures:

Using the commandline arguments, the Anagram Finder can opt to use three different Data Structures
to store and search its found anagrams, a HashMap, BinarySearchTree, and a RedBlack tree. Using either
of these Data Structures to perform the anagram search will yield different execution times based on
the efficiency of the Data Structures.
